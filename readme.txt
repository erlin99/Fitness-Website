I DECIDED TO GO WITH SECOND OPTION.
I DECIDED TO CREATE A WEBSITE ABOUT PERSONAL TRAINING. CREATED AN IMAGINARY GYM WHERE CLASSES ARE OFFERED AS WELL AS PERSONAL WORKOUTS. 

I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD OF THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE FINAL WEBSITE. I THINK IT HAS A GOOD DESIGN AND IT IS APPEALING TO THE EYES. 
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE BOOK ONLINE PAGE, WHERE I CREATED 2 TABS AND IN WITHIN THOSE TABS THERE ARE COLLAPSIBLE BOXES OF INFORMATION, AND THE SLIDESHOW ON THE SERVICES SECTION OF THE WEBSITE.
